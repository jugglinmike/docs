}

The Sauce Labs REST API is accessed over HTTPS, with standard HTTP methods and authentication, and using [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) encoding for request and response data.

The API is versioned by URL. The current version is v1, and resides under the `saucelabs.com/rest/v1/` base URL. Some v1.1 methods have been introduced under `saucelabs.com/rest/v1.1/`.

## Sauce API libraries

If you use Java, Ruby, PHP or node.js, you can use one of the below API libraries to conveniently access our API:

</ul>

## Getting Started

The Sauce Labs REST API uses [HTTP Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). To authenticate, either include the Sauce username and access key in the request URL like so:
```bash
curl https://sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey@saucelabs.com/rest/v1/users/sauceUsername
```

Or add an `Authorization` header to the request like this:
```bash
curl https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/users/sauceUsername \
-u sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey 
```

Note that all below endpoints default to a `GET` request unless specified, and all `POST` requests **must** have the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.

## Partners

This section is for use only by Sauce Labs partner accounts. If you use these commands with a standard account, they may cause unexpected behavior. To add and manage sub-accounts, head to [your sub-accounts page](https://saucelabs.com/sub-accounts).

### Create Account With Plan

        "password": "subaccount-password", 
        "name": "sauceUsername_subaccount_name", 
        "email": "subaccount-email-address", 
        "plan": "free"}'
```

### Update Subaccount Plan

-X DELETE \
https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/SUBACCOUNT_USERNAME/subscription
```

## Temporary Storage

Sauce Labs provides temporary storage inside our network for mobile apps, Selenium jars, prerun executables, and other assets required by your tests. Storing assets in our network can eliminate network latency problems when sending big files to Sauce. Here's how you use our storage:

* Before tests start, upload the file via our REST API as described below.
* During tests, use a `sauce-storage:` URL for the file, in the following format: `"sauce-storage:your_file_name"`
* Sauce will find the file, download it through our fast internal network, and get your tests started right away.

Please note that our temporary storage retains files for only seven days. We recommend users of this service upload files via our REST API every time their tests are about to run, as part of their build process.

### Upload File

Upload a file to temporary storage.

URL: `https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/storage/:username/:your_file_name`

Method: `POST`

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -u sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/storage/sauceUsername/test_file_name?overwrite=true \
--data-binary @/path/to/your_file_name
```

This can be scripted in any programming language. Just make sure the HTTP method being used is POST and the `Content-Type` header is correct.

**Optional Query Params:**

By default, the API prevents overwriting files already stored in Sauce temporary storage. The `overwrite=true` query parameter (shown in the example above) can be added to allow overwriting.

## JS Unit Testing

If you already have JS unit tests, running them on Sauce using the REST API is simple. If you are using Karma or want to setup a new test suite, check out our [JS Unit Testing Tutorial](/tutorials/js-unit-testing/).

### Start JS Unit Tests

Start your JavaScript unit tests on as many browsers as you like with a single request.

URL: `https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/:username/js-tests`

Method: `POST`

**Request Fields:**
* `platforms`(required): an array of platforms
* `url`(required): should point to the page that hosts your tests.
* `framework`(required): can be `"qunit"`, `"jasmine"`, `"YUI Test"`, `"mocha"`, or `"custom"`.

The `"custom"` framework allows you to display generic test information on the Sauce Labs website. Set `window.global_test_results` in the following format on your unit test page and Sauce will report any failing tests:

```js
window.global_test_results = {
  "passed": 1,
  "failed": 3,
  "total": 4,
  "duration": 4321,
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "foo test",
      "result": false,
      "message": "sumthin bad",
      "duration": 4000
    },
    {
      "name": "bar test",
      "result": false,
      "message": "failure",
      "duration": 300
    },
    {
      "name": "baz test",
      "result": true,
      "message": "passed",
      "duration": 20
    },
    {
      "name": "qux test",
      "result": false,
      "message": "test bad",
      "duration": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/sauceUsername/js-tests \
-X POST \
-u sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "platforms": [["Windows 7", "firefox", "27"],
                 ["Linux", "googlechrome", ""]],
    "url": "https://saucelabs.com/test_helpers/front_tests/index.html",
    "framework": "jasmine"}'
```

Hosting your tests on your LAN or your laptop? You'll need to run [Sauce Connect](/reference/sauce-connect/) to bridge Sauce Labs to your local network. Optional parameters related to Sauce Connect include:

* `tunnel-identifier`: specifies the ID of a specific tunnel when using multiple Sauce Connect tunnels.
* `parent_tunnel`: specifies the username of a parent account whose shared Sauce Connect tunnel your tests should use.

Any other parameters get passed on as [Optional Desired Capabilities](/reference/test-configuration/#webdriver-api) for the selenium server. This means you can set things like: `max-duration`

The default `max-duration` for all JS unit tests is 180 seconds.

### Get JS Unit Test Status

Get the status of your JS unit tests

URL `https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/:username/js-tests/status`

Method: `POST`

**Request Fields:**
* `js tests`(required): an array of job ids which you would like the status of

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/sauceUsername/js-tests/status \
-X POST \
-u sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"js tests": ["JOB_ID_1","JOB_ID_2"]}'
```

Do that a few times as the tests run, waiting until the response contains `"completed": true` to get the final results.
